0	1		Move card left when triggered?			
0	1		Double 1 Mission Reward on the card to the right.			
0	3		Copy the Backup Plan to the right of this card.			Combo Duplicator. Duplicates an adjacent effect for double value in one turn.
0	3		Move 1 Reward on each card left in your tableau. When N of the same kind are on the same card, do X.			(why?) Combo Engine. Complex reward management that leads to a huge, scalable bonus (X).
0	1		Block a player from swapping your Mission Rewards.			Feels too situational and underpowered. It also nerfs the other player’s card. Maybe these need to be one-time/reactive? Opportunity cost here feels very high. Maybe play from hand as an interrupt on top of a face-down card?
